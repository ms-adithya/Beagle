      <h1>The Beagle Blog</h1>
      <p>
        The <b>Beagle</b> is a breed of small scent hound, similar in appearance
        to the much larger foxhound. The beagle was developed primarily for
        hunting rabbit or hare, known as beagling. Possessing a great sense of
        smell and superior tracking instincts, the Beagle is the primary breed
        used as a detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and
        foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The beagle is a popular pet
        due to its size and good temper. The modern breed was developed in Great
        Britain around the 1830s from several breeds, including the Talbot
        Hound, the North Country Beagle, the Southern Hound, and possibly the
        Harrier. Beagles have been depicted in popular culture since Elizabethan
        times in literature and paintings and more recently in film, television,
        and comic books.
